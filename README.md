# navpa
Navpa is non-software, deriving its name from _nav pa'_, Klingon for [paper town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_settlement). Paper towns, aslo known as phantom settlements, were historically used to detect plagiarism and possible copyright violation published works, such as maps and dictionaries (see also the excellent [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Towns_(novel)) by the same name by author and YouTuber [John Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Green)).

The purpose of creating navpa is not primarily to detect copyright or license violations, but to track possible uncritical copying and republishing derivatives of the primary software annotations from the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) software registry.

As non-software, navpa is fittingly written entirely in Whitespace, and the codebase consists of a single file, navpa.ws, which is empty. An empty file is technically a valid Whitespace program, doing nothing. It does not produce output of any kind, perform any operations, or cause any errors. This is probably not a very useful software. On the other hand, it is probably equally harmless in most contexts.
